# G_TaskCenter

Centralized personal organizer project. This handles the orchestration of calendar backlogs, task organization, and productivity sync between Gmail, Notion, Outlook, and potentially others.

## Purpose

Main hub for personal productivity under the `03_PERSONAL` domain of Antigravity OS.
It is explicitly set up to use local MCP sidecar servers to securely integrate with daily productivity tools, offering a unified overview of all tasks.
